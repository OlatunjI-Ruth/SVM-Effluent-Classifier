# SVM-Effluent-Classifier
This is an SVM model that classifies effluent quality as Safe or Unsafe for drinking.

# The inspiration behind this Project
The need to treat wastewater before discharge into water bodies or reuse cannot be overemphasized.
After treatment, there is need to determine the quality of the treated effluent in order to ensure that it conforms to acceptable standards.
Also, continuous monitoring and testing of treated wastewater could be cumbersome and expensive, therefore there is a need to have a predictive tool to determine the values of the treated effluent parameters so as to make the processes faster and more efficient, which in turn will increase the volume of effluent treated per day to ensure the increasing rate in the need of quality, portable and safe water is being met.
In addition, this project can help to know the usage of the effluent generated from the wastewater treatment plant, because the algorithm will be modelled such that it can classify the predicted effluent as either safe or unsafe for reuse or discharge

# About the Dataset
